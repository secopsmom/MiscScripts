<#
        .SYNOPSIS
        This script queries multiple Active Directory groups for new members in a domain.  It records group membership
        in a CSV file in the same location as the script is located. On the script's initial run it will simply record
        all members of all groups into this CSV file.  On subsequent runs it will query each group's member list and compare
        that list to what's in the CSV file.  Any differences are found (added or removed) the script will update the 
        CSV file to reflect current memberships + notify an admin on members added/removed.
        .NOTES
        Filename: Get-AdGroupMembershipChange.ps1
        .EXAMPLE
        PS> .\Get-AdGroupMembershipChange.ps1 -Group 'Enterprise Admins','Domain Admins','Schema Admins' -Email admin@contoso.com
	
        This example will query group memberships of the Enterprise Admins, Domain Admins and Schema Admins groups and email
        admin@contoso.com when a member is either added or removed from any of these groups.

        .PARAMETER Group
        One or more group names to monitor for membership changes
        .PARAMETER DomainController
        By default the Active Directory module will automatically find a domain controller to query. If this parameter is set
        the script will directly query this domain controller.
        .PARAMETER Email
        The email address of the administrator that would like to get notified of group changes.
        .PARAMETER LogFilePath
        The path to where the group membership CSV file will be placed.  This is the file that will record the most recent
        group membership and will be used to compare current to most recent.

                .SYNOPSIS
                This function creates or appends a line to a log file

                .DESCRIPTION
                This function writes a log line to a log file
                .PARAMETER  Message
                The message parameter is the log message you'd like to record to the log file
                .PARAMETER  LogLevel
                The logging level is the severity rating for the message you're recording. 
                You have 3 severity levels available; 1, 2 and 3 from informational messages
                for FYI to critical messages. This defaults to 1.

                .EXAMPLE
                PS C:\> Write-Log -Message 'Value1' -LogLevel 'Value2'
			
                This example shows how to call the Write-Log function with named parameters.
